- Abstract: This paper investigates the information geometrical structure of a determinantal point process (DPP). It demonstrates that a DPP is embedded in the exponential family of log-linear models.  The extent of deviation from an exponential family is analyzed using the $\mathrm{e}$-embedding curvature tensor, which identifies partially flat parameters of a DPP. On the basis of this embedding structure, an information-geometrical relationship between a marginal kernel and an $L$-ensemble kernel is discovered.

This paper provide a curved exponential family representation of the determinatal point process.
In partitucular, two key quantities are investigated:
- $\theta(u)$: an embedding structure
- $\psi(u)$: a conditional potential function
The code in this page
- shows that a curved exponential family expression actually describes the probability of DPP; and
- depicts the shape of the conditional potential function and the embedding function.
